# 28 — Wireless Communication: Wi-Fi and Mobile Data

## Overview

Wireless communication allows devices to transmit data without physical cables.

Instead of electrical signals traveling through wires, wireless systems use electromagnetic waves to transmit information through the air.

Wi-Fi and mobile data are two common wireless communication technologies.

## Wi-Fi

Wi-Fi allows devices to connect to a local network wirelessly.

Basic path:

Device → Wi-Fi Router → Internet Service Provider (ISP) → Internet

The router converts:

- Wireless radio signals from your device
- Into wired signals that travel through fiber or cable infrastructure

Wi-Fi operates using radio frequencies, typically 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz bands.

---

## How Wi-Fi Works

1. Your device converts data into radio signals.
2. The router receives those signals.
3. The router forwards data to the internet.
4. Responses return through the router.
5. The router transmits data back wirelessly to your device.

Even though your connection is wireless, it ultimately connects to physical infrastructure.

## Mobile Data (4G / 5G)

Mobile data connects your device through cellular networks.

Basic path:

Device → Cell Tower → Mobile Network → Internet

Your phone communicates with nearby cell towers using radio waves.

The mobile network then routes traffic to the wider internet.

## What Is a Mobile Network?

A mobile network consists of:

- Cell towers
- Switching systems
- Core network infrastructure
- Backhaul fiber connections

It functions similarly to wired internet but uses radio signals between device and tower.

---

## Key Differences: Wi-Fi vs Mobile Data

Wi-Fi:
- Short-range
- Uses local router
- Typically lower latency indoors
- Requires fixed broadband connection

Mobile Data:
- Wide coverage area
- Uses cellular towers
- Works while moving
- Managed by mobile carrier

Both rely on radio frequency transmission.

---

## Signal Transmission

Wireless signals are:

- Encoded as electromagnetic waves
- Modulated to carry binary data
- Decoded back into digital information

Although wireless, the data is still binary at its core.

---

## Security in Wireless Networks

Wi-Fi networks use encryption standards such as:

- WPA2
- WPA3

Mobile networks use built-in encryption protocols to secure data transmission.

---

## Summary

Wireless communication transmits data using electromagnetic waves instead of cables.

Wi-Fi connects devices to a local router.
Mobile data connects devices to cellular towers.

Both ultimately connect to the global internet infrastructure.
