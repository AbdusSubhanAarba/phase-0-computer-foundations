# 29 — Data Protection and Encryption

## Overview

Data protection ensures that information remains:

- Confidential
- Intact
- Accessible only to authorized users

Encryption is one of the primary tools used to protect data.

Modern internet communication relies heavily on encryption to prevent unauthorized access.

---

## What Is Encryption?

Encryption is the process of converting readable data (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext).

Only someone with the correct key can convert it back to readable form.

Without the key, encrypted data appears meaningless.

---

## Why Encryption Is Necessary

When data travels across networks:

- It passes through multiple routers.
- It may travel across public infrastructure.
- It can potentially be intercepted.

Encryption ensures that even if data is intercepted, it cannot be understood.

---

## Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric encryption uses a single key for both:

- Encryption
- Decryption

Both sender and receiver must share the same secret key.

It is fast and commonly used for large data transfers.

---

## Asymmetric Encryption

Asymmetric encryption uses two keys:

- Public key
- Private key

The public key encrypts data.
The private key decrypts it.

This allows secure communication without sharing a secret key in advance.

---

## HTTPS and Secure Communication

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) uses encryption to protect web traffic.

When you visit a secure website:

1. Your browser verifies the server's certificate.
2. A secure encrypted session is established.
3. Data is transmitted securely.

Encryption protects login credentials, financial information, and personal data.

---

## Firewalls

A firewall is a security system that monitors and controls network traffic.

It:

- Blocks unauthorized access
- Filters incoming and outgoing packets
- Enforces security policies

Firewalls protect systems from external threats.

---

## Data Integrity and Authentication

Data protection also involves:

- Ensuring data has not been altered
- Verifying user identity
- Preventing unauthorized access

Security systems combine encryption, authentication, and monitoring.

---

## Why This Matters

Without data protection:

- Sensitive information could be stolen.
- Systems could be compromised.
- Trust in digital communication would fail.

Security is essential for modern computing and online services.

---

## Summary

Data protection ensures confidentiality, integrity, and secure access to information.

Encryption converts readable data into secure ciphertext.

Secure communication over the internet relies on encryption, authentication, and network security systems.
