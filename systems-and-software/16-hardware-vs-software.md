# 16 — Hardware vs Software

## Overview

A computer system consists of two fundamental components:

- Hardware
- Software

Both are required for a computer to function.

Hardware provides the physical structure.  
Software provides the instructions that control it.

---

## What Is Hardware?

Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer.

These are tangible and can be touched.

Examples:

- CPU
- RAM
- SSD / HDD
- Motherboard
- GPU
- Keyboard
- Monitor
- Network card

Hardware operates using electrical signals and physical mechanisms.

Without software, hardware does nothing.

---

## What Is Software?

Software is a set of instructions that tells hardware what to do.

Software exists as binary code stored in memory or storage.

Examples:

- Operating systems
- Applications
- Device drivers
- System utilities

Software controls how hardware behaves.

---

## How They Work Together

Software does not directly manipulate physical components.

Instead:

1. Applications send requests.
2. The operating system manages those requests.
3. The CPU executes instructions.
4. Electrical signals control hardware components.

This interaction allows systems to function.

---

## Key Differences

Hardware:
- Physical
- Subject to wear and physical limits
- Requires electricity to operate

Software:
- Intangible
- Stored as binary instructions
- Controls behavior of hardware

Hardware provides capability.
Software provides direction.

---

## Dependency Relationship

Hardware without software is inactive.

Software without hardware cannot run.

They depend entirely on each other.

---

## Example

When opening a web browser:

- The software loads into RAM.
- The CPU executes instructions.
- The GPU renders graphics.
- The monitor displays output.

Software directs the process.
Hardware performs the work.

---

## Summary

Hardware is the physical structure of a computer.

Software is the set of instructions that control that structure.

Together, they form a functioning computing system.
