# 13 — What Is an Operating System?

## Overview

An Operating System (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and provides services for programs.

It acts as an intermediary between:

- Hardware (CPU, RAM, storage, devices)
- Applications (browser, editor, games)

Without an operating system, hardware cannot be used efficiently.

---

## Core Responsibilities of an Operating System

An OS is responsible for managing:

- CPU scheduling
- Memory allocation
- Storage access
- Device communication
- Process management
- Security and permissions

It ensures that multiple programs can run without interfering with each other.

---

## Process Management

A process is a running program.

The OS:

- Loads programs into memory.
- Assigns CPU time.
- Switches between processes rapidly.
- Terminates processes when finished.

This allows multitasking.

---

## Memory Management

The OS:

- Allocates RAM to programs.
- Prevents programs from accessing each other's memory.
- Uses virtual memory when RAM is limited.

This ensures system stability.

---

## File System Management

The OS manages how data is stored and retrieved.

It:

- Organizes files and directories.
- Handles read/write operations.
- Maintains file permissions.

Storage devices become usable through the file system.

---

## Device Management

The OS communicates with hardware using device drivers.

It:

- Sends commands to devices.
- Receives responses.
- Translates hardware signals into usable data.

Without drivers, devices cannot function properly.

---

## Security and Access Control

The OS enforces:

- User authentication
- Access permissions
- Process isolation

This prevents unauthorized access and system instability.

---

## Examples of Operating Systems

- Windows
- macOS
- Linux
- Android
- iOS

All modern computers rely on an OS to function.

---

## Why the OS Is Essential

The OS provides structure and coordination.

It ensures:

- Hardware is used efficiently.
- Applications run safely.
- Resources are allocated fairly.

It transforms raw hardware into a usable system.

---

## Summary

An operating system is system software that manages hardware resources and provides an environment for applications to run.

It coordinates CPU usage, memory, storage, devices, and security to make computing possible.
