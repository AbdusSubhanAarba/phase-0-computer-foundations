# 18 — The Binary Number System

## Overview

The binary number system is a base-2 numbering system that uses only two digits:

0 and 1

Computers use binary because digital circuits naturally operate in two stable states.

Binary aligns perfectly with how transistors function.

## Base-10 vs Base-2

Humans commonly use base-10 (decimal), which uses digits:

0 through 9

Each position represents a power of 10.

Example (decimal):
245 = (2 × 100) + (4 × 10) + (5 × 1)

Binary uses base-2.

Each position represents a power of 2.

## Binary Place Values

From right to left:

1  
2  
4  
8  
16  
32  
64  
128  
256  
...

Each position doubles the previous value.

## Example Conversion

Binary number:

1011

Calculate its decimal value:

(1 × 8)  
+ (0 × 4)  
+ (1 × 2)  
+ (1 × 1)  
= 11 (decimal)

## Why Binary Is Used in Computing

Digital circuits operate using voltage levels:

- Low voltage → 0
- High voltage → 1

Using only two states:

- Increases reliability
- Reduces errors
- Simplifies circuit design

Binary makes hardware stable and predictable.

## Binary in Data Representation

Binary is used to represent:

- Numbers
- Characters (ASCII, Unicode)
- Memory addresses
- Machine instructions
- Colors in images
- Audio samples

All digital information reduces to sequences of bits.

---

## Binary and Logic

Binary works directly with logic gates.

Logical operations such as:

- AND
- OR
- NOT
- XOR

Operate on binary inputs.

This allows computers to perform:

- Comparisons
- Arithmetic
- Decision-making

---

## Importance in Computer Architecture

The CPU processes instructions in binary.

Memory stores data in binary.

Storage devices encode data in binary.

At every level of computing, binary is the foundational representation system.

---

## Summary

The binary number system is a base-2 system using only 0 and 1.

It matches the physical behavior of transistors and digital circuits.

All modern computing systems rely on binary representation.
