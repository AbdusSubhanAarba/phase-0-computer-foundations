# 17 — Bits and Bytes

## Overview

Bits and bytes are the fundamental units of digital data.

All information inside a computer is represented using bits.

Understanding bits and bytes is essential for understanding memory, storage, and data size.

## What Is a Bit?

A bit (short for binary digit) is the smallest unit of data in computing.

A bit can have only two possible values:

- 0
- 1

Physically, a bit represents:

- Low voltage or high voltage
- Off or on
- False or true

All digital systems are built from bits.

---

## What Is a Byte?

A byte is a group of 8 bits.

Example:

01000001

This sequence of 8 bits forms one byte.

A byte can represent values from:

0 to 255 (in decimal)

---

## Why 8 Bits?

Eight bits became standard because they are large enough to represent:

- Numbers
- Characters (letters and symbols)
- Basic data types

For example:

The letter "A" in ASCII is represented as:

01000001

## Data Measurement Units

Computers measure data using larger units:

- 1 Byte = 8 bits
- 1 Kilobyte (KB) = 1,024 bytes
- 1 Megabyte (MB) = 1,024 KB
- 1 Gigabyte (GB) = 1,024 MB
- 1 Terabyte (TB) = 1,024 GB

These units describe memory and storage capacity.

---

## Bits in Memory and Storage

RAM stores data as bits using electrical charge.

SSDs store bits using trapped electrons.

HDDs store bits using magnetic orientation.

Regardless of storage method, everything reduces to binary states.

---

## Why Bits Matter

All digital content is built from bits:

- Text
- Images
- Audio
- Video
- Programs
- Operating systems

Complex systems are ultimately collections of binary values.

---

## Summary

A bit is the smallest unit of digital information and represents either 0 or 1.

A byte consists of 8 bits and can represent numbers, characters, and data values.

All computing systems store and process information using bits and bytes.
