# 15 — What Is a Computer?

## Overview

A computer is an electronic machine that processes data according to instructions.

At its core, a computer:

- Accepts input
- Processes data
- Produces output
- Stores information

All of this is performed using electrical signals and logical operations.

## The Four Basic Functions

### 1. Input

A computer receives data through input devices.

Examples:
- Keyboard
- Mouse
- Microphone
- Network connection

Input is converted into electrical signals.

---

### 2. Processing

The CPU processes instructions stored in memory.

It:

- Performs arithmetic operations
- Makes logical decisions
- Moves data between memory and registers
- Controls hardware components

Processing is done through the fetch–decode–execute cycle.

---

### 3. Output

After processing, the computer produces results.

Examples:
- Displaying text on a screen
- Playing sound
- Sending data over the internet

Output devices convert electrical signals into visible or audible results.

---

### 4. Storage

Computers store data in:

- RAM (temporary storage)
- SSD or HDD (permanent storage)

Stored data includes:
- Programs
- Files
- Operating system components

## The Core Components of a Computer

A computer system typically consists of:

- CPU (processing)
- RAM (working memory)
- Storage (long-term memory)
- Motherboard (connects components)
- Input/Output devices
- Power supply

Each component performs a specific function.

---

## What Makes It “Digital”

Computers are digital because they:

- Use binary (0 and 1)
- Represent data using voltage levels
- Perform operations using logic gates

All modern computing relies on controlled electrical switching.

---

## What a Computer Is Not

A computer does not think or understand.

It:

- Follows programmed instructions
- Executes logical operations
- Operates deterministically

Any appearance of intelligence comes from software design.

---

## Summary

A computer is an electronic system that:

- Receives input
- Processes data
- Produces output
- Stores information

It performs these tasks using binary logic and controlled electrical signals.
