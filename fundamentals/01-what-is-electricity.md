# 01 — What Is Electricity?

## Definition

Electricity is the movement of electric charge.

In most electronic systems, this charge is carried by electrons moving through conductive materials such as copper wires.

At its core, electricity is a physical phenomenon caused by the presence and motion of electrically charged particles.

## Two Main Forms of Electricity

### 1. Static Electricity

Static electricity is the buildup of electric charge on the surface of an object.

- Charges remain in one place
- No continuous flow
- Example: small spark when touching a metal object after walking on carpet

---

### 2. Current Electricity

Current electricity is the continuous flow of electric charge through a conductor.

This is the type used in:

- Computers
- Power systems
- Electronic devices

Current electricity is what enables circuits and digital logic to function.

## What Actually Moves?

In most circuits:

- Electrons move through metal conductors
- Their movement creates electric current
- The movement is driven by an electric field

Although electrons move physically, the signal (energy transfer) propagates extremely quickly through the conductor.

## Key Idea for Computing

Computers rely on controlled electrical states.

Electricity inside a computer is not random. It is:

- Directed
- Timed
- Controlled by transistors
- Represented as binary states (0 and 1)

Without electricity, no transistor can switch.
Without transistor switching, no computation occurs.

## Why Electricity Matters in Computing

Every level of a computer system depends on electricity:

- Logic gates operate using voltage levels
- CPUs execute instructions using electrical signals
- RAM stores data using electrical charge
- Storage devices use electrical mechanisms to write and read data

Electricity is the physical foundation of all digital systems.

## Summary

Electricity is the movement of electric charge, typically electrons, through a conductor.

Modern computers function by controlling this movement precisely, using electrical states to represent binary data and execute logical operations.
