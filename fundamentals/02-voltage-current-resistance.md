# 02 — Voltage, Current, and Resistance

## Overview

Voltage, current, and resistance are the three fundamental quantities that describe how electricity behaves in a circuit.

They define:

- Why electrons move
- How many electrons move
- What limits their movement

Understanding these concepts is essential for electronics and computing.

## 1. Voltage (V) — The Push

Voltage is the electrical potential difference between two points.

It represents the force that pushes electrons through a conductor.

Voltage is created by an electric field, which forms when charges are separated (for example, by battery chemistry or power generators).

- Higher voltage → stronger push
- Measured in volts (V)

### Example

A battery has voltage because its chemical reactions create an imbalance:
- One side has excess electrons
- The other side lacks electrons

This difference creates pressure that makes electrons want to move.

## 2. Current (I) — The Flow

Current is the flow of electric charge through a conductor.

More precisely, it describes how many electrons pass a point per second.

- More current → more charge flowing
- Measured in amperes (A)

### Important Concept

Voltage can exist without current.

Example:
A battery sitting alone has voltage.
But if it is not connected in a closed circuit, no current flows.

Current only exists when there is:
- Voltage
- A complete path (circuit)

## 3. Resistance (R) — The Opposition

Resistance is the opposition to the flow of electric current.

It describes how difficult it is for electrons to move through a material.

- Higher resistance → less current
- Measured in ohms (Ω)

Resistance occurs because electrons collide with atoms in the material and lose energy as heat.

### Examples

- A thin wire has more resistance than a thick wire.
- Rubber has extremely high resistance and blocks current.
- Metal has low resistance and allows current to flow easily.

## The Relationship — Ohm’s Law

Voltage, current, and resistance are connected by Ohm’s Law:

I = V / R

Where:
- I = Current
- V = Voltage
- R = Resistance

This means:

- Increasing voltage increases current (if resistance stays the same).
- Increasing resistance decreases current (if voltage stays the same).

This relationship governs how all electrical circuits behave.

## Real-World Examples

### Phone Charger
- Voltage is regulated (5V, 9V, etc.).
- The device draws the current it needs.
- Internal resistance and control circuits ensure safe operation.

### Light Bulb
- The filament has resistance.
- Current flows through it.
- Electrical energy converts into heat and light.

### Computer / CPU
- Uses very small voltages (around 1V).
- Transistors switch based on voltage differences.
- Binary states (0 and 1) are represented by controlled voltage levels.

Computers rely on precise voltage control rather than large amounts of power.

## Safety Insight

The main factor that causes harm to the human body is current, not just voltage.

However:
Higher voltage makes it easier to force current through the body.

That is why household electrical systems are dangerous.

## Summary

Voltage pushes.
Current flows.
Resistance controls how much flows.

Together, these three quantities define how electrical systems operate.
