# 05 — What Is a Transistor?

## Overview

A transistor is a tiny electronic switch that controls the flow of electricity.

It can turn current on or off, or control how much current flows.

Modern computers contain billions of transistors.  
All digital computation is built from them.

## What a Transistor Does

A transistor has three main parts (in simple terms):

- Input (control)
- Output
- Power path

A small input signal controls whether a larger current is allowed to flow.

If control voltage is present → current flows.  
If control voltage is absent → current stops.

This switching behavior is the foundation of digital logic.

## Transistor as a Switch

In digital systems, transistors act like extremely tiny switches:

- ON state → current flows → represents binary 1  
- OFF state → no current → represents binary 0  

By combining millions or billions of these switches, computers perform calculations.

## How It Works (Conceptual)

A transistor works using semiconductor materials (usually silicon).

Inside the transistor:

- Voltage applied to one part creates an electric field.
- That electric field either allows or blocks current flow.
- The current path is controlled without mechanical movement.

There are no moving parts.  
Everything happens through electric fields inside solid material.

## Why Transistors Matter

Transistors make it possible to:

- Build logic gates
- Store binary values
- Perform arithmetic operations
- Execute instructions inside a CPU
- Control memory and storage systems

Without transistors:

- No logic gates
- No processors
- No modern computers

## From Transistors to Logic

One transistor is just a switch.

But when multiple transistors are connected together, they form:

- AND gates
- OR gates
- NOT gates
- Complex logical circuits

These circuits combine to form:

- Adders
- Registers
- Memory cells
- Entire CPUs

Everything digital begins with transistor switching.

## Scale in Modern Computers

Modern processors contain billions of transistors.

Each transistor switches on and off billions of times per second.

This massive, synchronized switching is what we experience as computing power.

---

## Summary

A transistor is a microscopic electronic switch that controls current using voltage.

By switching between on and off states, transistors represent binary values (0 and 1).

All digital systems — from logic gates to CPUs — are built from transistors.
