# 03 — What Is a Circuit?

## Definition

A circuit is a complete, closed path that allows electric current to flow.

Without a complete path, electrons cannot move continuously, and no current exists.

A circuit must form a loop from the power source, through components, and back to the power source.

---

## Why a Circuit Must Be Closed

Electric current only flows when:

- There is voltage (a push)
- There is a complete path (a loop)

If the path is broken, current stops immediately.

Example:
A battery connected to nothing has voltage.
But until a wire connects both terminals in a loop, no current flows.

## Basic Components of a Circuit

A simple circuit usually includes:

### 1. Power Source
Provides voltage.

Examples:
- Battery
- Power supply
- Generator

---

### 2. Conductors
Wires that allow electrons to move between components.

Usually made of copper because it has low resistance.

---

### 3. Load
A device that uses electrical energy.

Examples:
- Light bulb
- Motor
- Computer component
- Resistor

The load converts electrical energy into another form (light, motion, heat, computation).

---

### 4. Switch (Optional)
Controls whether the circuit is open or closed.

- Closed switch → current flows
- Open switch → circuit broken, no current

---

## Simple Circuit Example

Battery → Wire → Light Bulb → Wire → Back to Battery

If the loop is complete:
- Voltage pushes electrons
- Current flows
- Bulb lights up

If the loop is broken:
- No current
- Bulb stays off

## Types of Circuits

### Series Circuit
Components are connected in one single path.

- Same current flows through all components
- If one breaks, everything stops

---

### Parallel Circuit
Components are connected in multiple paths.

- Each branch gets the same voltage
- If one branch fails, others can continue working

Most modern electronic systems use parallel structures.

## Why Circuits Matter in Computing

Inside a computer:

- Transistors form tiny circuits
- Logic gates are built from circuits
- CPUs are made of billions of microscopic circuits

Every operation in a computer depends on controlled, closed electrical paths.

Without circuits, electricity cannot be directed or controlled.

## Summary

A circuit is a closed electrical loop that allows current to flow.

It requires:

- Voltage
- A complete path
- Components that use or control energy

All electronic systems — from light bulbs to CPUs — rely on circuits.
