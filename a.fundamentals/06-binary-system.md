# 06 — The Binary Number System

## Overview

The binary number system is a way of representing numbers using only two digits:

0 and 1

Computers use binary because transistors have two stable states:

- Off
- On

These two physical states naturally map to binary values.

---

## Why Computers Use Binary

Electronic circuits operate using voltage levels.

A transistor can reliably represent:

- Low voltage → 0
- High voltage → 1

Using only two states makes digital systems:

- Stable
- Reliable
- Less sensitive to noise
- Easier to control

Binary matches the physical reality of electronic switches.

## How Binary Works

Binary is a base-2 number system.

In base-10 (decimal), each digit position represents powers of 10:

Example:
245 = (2 × 100) + (4 × 10) + (5 × 1)

In binary (base-2), each digit position represents powers of 2.

Example:
1011 (binary) =

(1 × 8) +  
(0 × 4) +  
(1 × 2) +  
(1 × 1)

= 11 (decimal)

## Place Values in Binary

From right to left:

1  
2  
4  
8  
16  
32  
64  
128  
...

Each position doubles.

---

## Bits and Bytes

A single binary digit (0 or 1) is called a bit.

8 bits together form a byte.

Example:

00000001 = 1  
00000010 = 2  
00000011 = 3  

A byte can represent values from 0 to 255.

---

## Binary in Computing

Binary is used to represent:

- Numbers
- Text (ASCII / Unicode)
- Images
- Audio
- Instructions
- Memory addresses

Everything inside a computer ultimately becomes sequences of 0s and 1s.

---

## Binary and Logic

Binary works together with logic gates.

Example:

AND gate:
1 AND 1 = 1  
1 AND 0 = 0  

These simple operations allow computers to:

- Compare values
- Make decisions
- Perform calculations

---

## Why This Matters

Binary is not just a number system.

It is the language of hardware.

Transistors switch.
Switching creates binary.
Binary builds logic.
Logic builds computation.

---

## Summary

Binary is a base-2 number system using only 0 and 1.

It aligns perfectly with the on/off nature of transistors.

All digital systems are built on binary representation.
