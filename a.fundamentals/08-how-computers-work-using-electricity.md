# 08 — How Computers Work Using Electricity

## Overview

Computers work by controlling electricity in extremely precise ways.

At the lowest level, a computer is a system that:

- Controls voltage levels
- Switches transistors on and off
- Represents data as binary (0 and 1)
- Executes logic using circuits

Everything inside a computer ultimately reduces to electrical behavior.

## Step 1 — Electricity Becomes Binary

Transistors have two stable states:

- Low voltage → 0
- High voltage → 1

These two states represent binary values.

Binary is the language of digital systems.

---

## Step 2 — Binary Forms Logic

Transistors are connected to form logic gates:

- AND
- OR
- NOT
- XOR
- NAND
- NOR

Logic gates take binary inputs and produce binary outputs.

This allows computers to:

- Compare values
- Perform arithmetic
- Make decisions

---

## Step 3 — Logic Forms Circuits

When logic gates are combined in larger structures, they form:

- Adders (for arithmetic)
- Multiplexers
- Registers
- Memory cells
- Control circuits

These circuits perform structured operations.

---

## Step 4 — Circuits Form the CPU

The CPU contains:

- Billions of transistors
- Organized into logic units
- Coordinated by a clock signal

The CPU performs operations using a repeating cycle:

1. Fetch instruction
2. Decode instruction
3. Execute instruction

All of this is implemented using electrical switching.

---

## Step 5 — Memory and Storage

Electricity is also used to:

- Store temporary data in RAM
- Control NAND cells in SSDs
- Represent instructions and addresses

Memory works by storing electrical states.

---

## The Role of the Clock

Computers use a clock signal to synchronize operations.

The clock is an electrical pulse that turns on and off repeatedly.

Each pulse coordinates:

- When instructions move
- When data transfers
- When circuits update

This ensures everything operates in order.

---

## What We Experience as “Software”

When we run programs:

- Software becomes machine code.
- Machine code becomes binary.
- Binary becomes electrical signals.
- Electrical signals switch transistors.
- Transistors produce logical results.

The user sees:

- Graphics
- Sound
- Interaction

But underneath, it is controlled electricity.

---

## Key Insight

Computers do not “think.”

They:

- Switch electrical states
- Follow logical rules
- Execute predefined instructions

Everything is deterministic electrical behavior.

---

## Summary

Computers work by controlling electrical signals.

Transistors switch.
Switching creates binary.
Binary forms logic.
Logic builds circuits.
Circuits execute instructions.

All modern computing is controlled electricity operating at extremely high speed.
