# 26 — How the Internet Works

## Overview

The internet is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate using standardized protocols.

It allows devices around the world to exchange data reliably and efficiently.

The internet is not a single system, but a massive network of smaller networks.

## Basic Concept

When you access a website:

1. Your device sends a request.
2. The request travels through multiple networks.
3. A server receives the request.
4. The server sends a response.
5. The data travels back to your device.

All communication happens through packets of data.

## What Are Data Packets?

Data sent over the internet is broken into small units called packets.

Each packet contains:

- Part of the data
- Source address
- Destination address
- Routing information

Packets may take different paths but are reassembled at the destination.

---

## IP Addresses

Every device connected to the internet has an IP (Internet Protocol) address.

An IP address:

- Identifies the device
- Enables routing
- Ensures correct delivery

It functions like a digital address.

---

## Domain Names and DNS

Humans use domain names instead of numeric IP addresses.

Example:
example.com

DNS (Domain Name System) translates domain names into IP addresses.

DNS acts like a phonebook for the internet.

---

## Routers and Routing

Routers direct packets between networks.

When a packet travels:

- It moves from router to router.
- Each router decides the best next path.
- The packet continues until it reaches its destination.

This process is called routing.

---

## Protocols

The internet relies on communication protocols.

Important protocols include:

- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- IP (Internet Protocol)
- HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
- HTTPS (Secure HTTP)

Protocols define how data is structured and transmitted.

---

## TCP vs IP

IP handles addressing and routing.

TCP ensures reliable delivery by:

- Checking for lost packets
- Reordering packets if needed
- Resending missing data

Together, TCP/IP forms the foundation of internet communication.

---

## Physical Infrastructure

The internet operates over:

- Fiber optic cables
- Undersea cables
- Satellite links
- Cellular networks

Even wireless communication eventually connects to wired infrastructure.

---

## Summary

The internet is a global network of networks that transmits data using packets.

Devices communicate using IP addresses and standardized protocols.

Routers direct traffic, and servers respond to requests.

All internet activity ultimately relies on electrical and optical signal transmission.
