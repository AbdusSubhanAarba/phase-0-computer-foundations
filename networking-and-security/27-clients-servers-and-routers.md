# 27 — Clients, Servers, and Routers

## Overview

Modern networks operate using a structured model involving:

- Clients
- Servers
- Routers

Each plays a distinct role in communication over the internet.

Understanding these roles explains how web browsing, messaging, and online services function.

---

## What Is a Client?

A client is a device or program that requests data or services.

Examples:

- Web browser requesting a webpage
- Mobile app requesting data
- Computer requesting a file

The client initiates communication.

When you type a website into a browser, your computer acts as the client.

---

## What Is a Server?

A server is a computer designed to provide data or services to clients.

Servers:

- Store websites
- Manage databases
- Host applications
- Process requests

When a client sends a request, the server processes it and sends back a response.

Servers are optimized for reliability and handling many simultaneous requests.

---

## Client-Server Model

The client-server model works as follows:

1. Client sends a request.
2. Server receives the request.
3. Server processes the request.
4. Server sends a response.
5. Client displays or uses the result.

This model forms the foundation of most internet services.

## What Is a Router?

A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between networks.

Routers:

- Connect local networks to the internet
- Determine the best path for data
- Direct packets toward their destination

They act as traffic controllers for data.

## How Data Travels

Example: Visiting a website

1. Your computer (client) sends a request.
2. The request goes to your router.
3. The router forwards it to your ISP.
4. It travels through multiple routers.
5. The server receives it.
6. The server responds.
7. The response travels back through routers to your device.

Each router makes decisions based on IP addresses.

## Local vs Remote Servers

Local server:
- Inside your own network

Remote server:
- Located elsewhere on the internet

Most websites use remote servers hosted in data centers.

---

## Why This Structure Matters

Separating roles ensures:

- Scalability
- Reliability
- Efficient resource use
- Organized communication

The internet would not function efficiently without this structured model.

---

## Summary

Clients request data.
Servers provide data.
Routers direct traffic between networks.

Together, they enable structured and reliable communication across the internet.
