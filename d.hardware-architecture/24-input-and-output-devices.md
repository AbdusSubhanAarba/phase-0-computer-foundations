# 24 — Input and Output Devices

## Overview

Input and Output (I/O) devices allow humans and external systems to communicate with a computer.

Input devices send data into the computer.
Output devices present processed data to the user.

Without I/O devices, a computer would operate internally but provide no usable interaction.

## Input Devices

Input devices capture external data and convert it into electrical signals.

Common input devices include:

- Keyboard
- Mouse
- Touchscreen
- Microphone
- Webcam
- Scanner

When an input occurs:

1. The device detects physical interaction.
2. It converts that interaction into electrical signals.
3. The signals are sent to the operating system.
4. The CPU processes the data.

Example:
Pressing a key sends a signal that the OS interprets as a character.

## Output Devices

Output devices receive processed data and convert it into human-readable or perceivable form.

Common output devices include:

- Monitor
- Speakers
- Printer
- Headphones
- Projector

After processing:

1. The CPU sends instructions to the appropriate device.
2. Electrical signals are transmitted.
3. The device converts signals into visual, audio, or physical output.

Example:
The GPU sends pixel data to the monitor, which lights up pixels accordingly.

## Devices That Perform Both

Some devices act as both input and output.

Examples:

- Touchscreen (display + touch input)
- Headset (microphone + speakers)
- Network card (send and receive data)

These devices both transmit and receive signals.

## How I/O Connects to the System

Input and output devices communicate through:

- Motherboard ports
- USB controllers
- PCIe interfaces
- Device drivers

The operating system manages and coordinates these interactions.

---

## Why I/O Is Important

I/O devices allow:

- User interaction
- External communication
- Data exchange
- Control of applications

They form the interface between digital processing and the real world.

---

## Summary

Input devices send data into the computer.
Output devices present processed data to the outside world.

They convert physical interaction into electrical signals and vice versa.

All computing systems depend on effective input and output mechanisms.
