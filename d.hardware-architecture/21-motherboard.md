# 21 — The Motherboard

## Overview

The motherboard is the main circuit board of a computer.

It connects, powers, and allows communication between all major components, including:

- CPU
- RAM
- Storage devices
- GPU
- Power supply
- Input/output devices

Without the motherboard, individual components cannot function together as a system.

---

## Core Functions of the Motherboard

The motherboard is responsible for:

- Distributing power to components
- Routing data signals between components
- Providing physical connection points
- Coordinating hardware communication

It acts as the central infrastructure of the computer.

---

## Key Components on the Motherboard

### CPU Socket

The CPU socket holds the processor and provides electrical connections.

Each motherboard supports specific CPU types and socket standards.

---

### RAM Slots

RAM modules are installed into dedicated slots.

These slots connect memory directly to the CPU for high-speed data access.

---

### Chipset

The chipset manages communication between:

- CPU
- Storage devices
- USB ports
- Expansion slots

It controls how data flows through the system.

---

### PCIe Slots

PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express) slots allow expansion cards such as:

- Graphics cards (GPU)
- NVMe storage
- Network cards

PCIe lanes provide high-speed data paths.

---

### Storage Connectors

Motherboards provide:

- SATA ports for HDDs and SATA SSDs
- M.2 slots for NVMe SSDs

These connectors link storage devices to the system.

---

### Power Connectors

The motherboard receives power from the power supply unit (PSU).

It distributes and regulates voltage for:

- CPU
- RAM
- Chipset
- Other components

Voltage regulation modules (VRMs) ensure stable power delivery.

---

## How Data Moves Through the Motherboard

Data travels through copper traces embedded in the board.

These traces carry electrical signals between components.

The motherboard ensures signals are:

- Synchronized
- Routed correctly
- Electrically stable

---

## Why the Motherboard Matters

A motherboard determines:

- What CPU is supported
- How much RAM can be installed
- Available expansion options
- Storage compatibility
- Upgrade potential

It influences system capabilities but does not directly determine raw performance.

---

## Summary

The motherboard is the central circuit board that connects and powers all computer components.

It provides communication pathways, power regulation, and expansion capability.

It transforms separate hardware components into a functioning system.
