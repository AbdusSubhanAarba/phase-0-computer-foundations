# 23 — Power Supply and Cooling

## Overview

A computer requires two critical systems to operate safely:

- A stable power supply
- Effective cooling

Power enables components to function.
Cooling prevents damage caused by heat.

Both are essential for performance and reliability.

## Power Supply Unit (PSU)

The Power Supply Unit converts electrical power from a wall outlet into usable power for computer components.

Wall power:
- High voltage
- Alternating current (AC)

Computer components require:
- Lower voltage
- Direct current (DC)
- Stable and regulated output

The PSU performs this conversion and distributes power throughout the system.

---

## Voltage Rails

The PSU provides different voltage levels, commonly:

- 12V
- 5V
- 3.3V

These supply various components such as:

- CPU
- GPU
- Storage devices
- Motherboard circuitry

Stable voltage is critical to prevent system instability.

---

## Power Distribution

Power flows:

Wall → PSU → Motherboard → Components

Voltage regulation modules (VRMs) on the motherboard ensure precise voltage control for sensitive components like the CPU.

---

## Why Cooling Is Necessary

When electricity flows through circuits:

- Some energy is lost as heat.
- Higher performance produces more heat.

Excess heat can cause:

- Thermal throttling (automatic slowdown)
- System instability
- Hardware damage

Cooling systems remove heat to maintain safe operating temperatures.

---

## Air Cooling

Air cooling uses:

- Heat sinks
- Fans
- Airflow through the case

Heat sinks absorb heat from components.
Fans move warm air away and bring in cooler air.

This is the most common cooling method.

---

## Liquid Cooling

Liquid cooling systems use:

- A pump
- Coolant
- Radiator
- Tubing

Heat is transferred to liquid and carried away to a radiator for dissipation.

Liquid cooling can be more efficient for high-performance systems.

---

## Thermal Paste

Thermal paste improves heat transfer between:

- CPU surface
- Heat sink

It fills microscopic gaps to improve thermal conductivity.

---

## Power and Performance

More performance requires:

- More electrical power
- More heat management

System design must balance:

- Power delivery
- Thermal limits
- Stability

---

## Summary

The power supply provides stable electrical energy to all components.

Cooling systems remove excess heat to prevent damage and maintain performance.

Both are essential for safe and reliable computer operation.
