# 25 — Computer Ports: USB, HDMI, and Ethernet

## Overview

Computer ports are physical interfaces that allow devices to connect to a computer.

Ports enable the transfer of:

- Data
- Power
- Audio
- Video
- Network signals

They serve as communication gateways between internal components and external devices.

## USB (Universal Serial Bus)

USB is a widely used interface for connecting peripherals.

Common uses:

- Keyboard
- Mouse
- External storage
- Smartphones
- Printers
- Webcams

USB can carry:

- Data
- Electrical power
- In some cases, video signals (USB-C)

Different USB versions provide different data speeds.

## HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface)

HDMI transmits:

- Digital video
- Digital audio

It connects a computer to:

- Monitor
- Television
- Projector

The GPU sends visual and audio data through HDMI to the display device.

HDMI simplifies connections by combining video and audio into one cable.

## Ethernet

Ethernet is used for wired network communication.

It connects a computer to:

- Router
- Local network
- Internet infrastructure

Ethernet provides:

- Stable connection
- Lower latency
- Higher reliability compared to wireless connections

Data travels as electrical signals through network cables.

## How Ports Work

When a device is connected:

1. Physical connectors establish electrical contact.
2. The operating system detects the device.
3. Device drivers manage communication.
4. Data is transmitted as binary electrical signals.

Ports provide structured pathways for signal exchange.

---

## Why Ports Matter

Ports determine:

- Device compatibility
- Data transfer speed
- Display capability
- Network performance

They extend the computer’s functionality beyond its internal components.

## Summary

Computer ports are physical connection points that allow communication between the computer and external devices.

USB handles general peripherals.
HDMI transmits audio and video.
Ethernet enables wired network communication.

All operate through structured electrical signal transfer.
